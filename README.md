A cross-platform Discord music bot with a clean interface, and that is easy to set up and run yourself!


## Features
  * Easy to run (just make sure Java is installed, and run!)
  * Fast loading of songs
  * No external keys needed (besides a Discord Bot token)
  * Smooth playback
  * Server-specific setup for the "DJ" role that can moderate the music
  * Clean and beautiful menus
  * Supports many sites, including Youtube, Soundcloud, and more
  * Supports many online radio/streams
  * Supports local files
  * Playlist support (both web/youtube, and local)


## Editing
This bot (and the source code here) might not be easy to edit for inexperienced programmers. The main purpose of having the source public is to show the capabilities of the libraries, to allow others to understand how the bot works, and to allow those knowledgeable about java, JDA, and Discord bot development to contribute. There are many requirements and dependencies required to edit and compile it, and there will not be support provided for people looking to make changes on their own.
